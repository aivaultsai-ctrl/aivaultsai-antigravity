# AIVaultsAI Autonomous Workforce - Daily Execution Report
**Date:** December 13, 2025
**System Status:** ACTIVE
**Objective:** Revenue Generation

---

## 1. SALES AGENT ("Hunter") - Output
**Target Sector:** Real Estate Agencies (Mid-Size, 5-15 agents) & E-Commerce Brands (Scaling to $50k/mo).

### A. Lead Targets (10 Prospects)
1. **Nexus Estate Agents** (High volume listings, manual follow-up).
2. **Urban Nest Realty** (Active social, slow DM response).
3. **Prestige Properties** (Growing team, asking for "admin" help in bio).
4. **GlowSkin Co.** (E-com, missed comments on ads).
5. **FitLife Gear** (E-com, support ticket backlog).
6. **TechRecruit UK** (Recruitment, drowning in CV screening).
7. **LegalAssist Partners** (Law firm, manual intake forms).
8. **CreativeFlow Agency** (Marketing, burned out reporting).
9. **BuildRight Construction** (Trades, quoting delays).
10. **DentalSmile Clinic** (Local biz, missed booking calls).

### B. Pitch Strategy (Copy-Paste)
**Subject:** "Your support team is asleep (My AI isn't)"
**Message:**
"Hey [Name], saw your ads running at 9 PM. They look great.

Problem is, when a lead asks a question at 9:05 PM, they wait 12 hours for a reply. By then, they bought from a competitor.

I built an AI Sales Agent that sits in your DMs/Inbox. It replies in 30 seconds, answers FAQs, and books calls 24/7. It costs less than your coffee budget.

Want to see a demo of it handling a lead?"

2.  **LinkedIn Carousel:** "5 Tasks You Should Nover Do Yourself Again." (Lead Qualification, Invoice Chasing, Meeting Scheduling, Data Entry, SOCIAL COMMENT REPLIES).

### Make.com Scenario
1.  **Trigger:** Shopify "New Order" OR Gmail "New Email" (Support).

## 5. OPERATIONS AGENT ("Manager") - Output
**Status Report:**
*   **Sales:** Prospects identified. Pitch is sharp. High probability of finding "pain" in Real Estate sector.
*   **Tech:** We have the infrastructure (Agent 4 built the Ops dashboard). We need to deploy the specific "Real Estate" preset prompt to the codebase.
*   **Bottleneck:** Need to actually *send* the DMs generated by Hunter.
*   **Next Step:** Stephan needs to copy the Sales Script and fire it to the top 3 leads on Instagram/LinkedIn output.

**Recommended Pricing for Today's Deals:**
*   **Setup Fee:** €497 (Waived if they sign up today).
*   **Monthly Retainer:** €99/mo per agent.

**Revenue Projection:**
*   If 2 closes today: €198 MRR + potential Setup Fees.
