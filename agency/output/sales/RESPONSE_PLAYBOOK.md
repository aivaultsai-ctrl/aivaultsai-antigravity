# Sales Response Playbook ("Hunter" Protocol)
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Trigger:** Prospect replies to the "DEPLOYED" Pitch.

---

## Scenario A: The "Yes" (Interest)
**Prospect says:** "Sure, show me." / "How does it work?" / "Send the demo."

**Response Script:**
"Awesome. Here is a 30s preview of it handling a difficult client: [LINK TO LOOM/VIDEO]

I can set this up for [Company Name] in about 20 minutes tonight.

Do you want to trial it for 48 hours? No cost, I just want a testimonial if you like it."

**Goal:** Get them to agree to a "Trial" (Low friction) or send them to `aivaultsai.one` (Self-serve).

---

## Scenario B: The "Price?" (Budget Check)
**Prospect says:** "How much is it?" / "Is it expensive?"

**Response Script:**
"It's €49/mo for the software (cheaper than your calendly subscription).

If you want me to build the custom 'Real Estate' workflow for you, it's a one-time €497 setup fee. But honestly, you can probably set it up yourself in 10 mins on the platform.

Want the link to try it yourself?"

---

## Scenario C: The "Skeptic" (Objection)
**Prospect says:** "Is this just ChatGPT?" / "We already use AI."

**Response Script:**
"Good question. ChatGPT waits for you to type. This agent lives in your inbox/DMs and acts *automatically* when leads message you at 3 AM.

It connects to your Calendar and CRM, which ChatGPT can't do easily.

It's an employee, not a tool. Makes sense?"

---

## Scenario D: The "Ghost" (No Reply)
**Trigger:** 24 Hours after initial message.

**Follow-up Script:**
"Hey [Name], just checking I didn't get buried.

I actually mocked up a quick demo using [Company Name]'s data. It looks pretty cool. Mind if I send it over?"
