## 1. Cold DM Framework (The "Intern" Angle)
**Context:** Instagram/Twitter DMs
**Constraint:** Under 280 chars first message.

**Message 1 (The Hook):**
"Hey [Name], quick weird question - are you still hiring human interns for content repurposing? Or have you switched to AI agents yet?"

**Message 2 (If they reply 'Humans' or 'Agency'):**
"Gotcha. Just asking because I built a bot that does the work of a junior copywriter (transcribing, posting, engaging) for $49/mo. It doesn't sleep or ask for raises. Want to see a 30s demo of it working?"

**Message 3 (The Close):**
"Here creates-content.mp4. If you want to try it, I'll waive the setup fee for you since we're just launching. Link: aivaultsai.one/special"

## 2. Inbound Lead Email Sequence
**Trigger:** User signs up for "Free Tier" but doesn't upgrade.

**Subject:** I fired my support team...
**Body:**
"Okay, not really. But I did stop hiring new ones.

Why? Because I initialized 'Juno', my AI support agent on AIVaultsAI.
She handles 80% of the FAQ queries instantly.
